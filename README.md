# TimeT

This is a single page application for time tracking, which allows you to create tasks and track the time spent on their execution. Tasks are conveniently organized into an intuitive folder system. The application is designed in this way so that it would be convenient to use it on a daily basis, keeping track of how much time certain tasks spend. The amount of time that is spent on a particular task, for a certain period of time, is convenient to track in the statistics window. In this window, it is possible to build a graph for one or several tasks at once in order to compare them. Time is displayed not only for tasks, but also for folders. Folder time is the total time of all tasks that are located there. For example, you have a folder called "household chores" and this folder contains several tasks. The statistics window will display not only the time spent on each specific task, but also the total time of all tasks, so you can easily find out how much time was spent on your household chores. Since any complexity of folder nesting is allowed, it is very convenient to customize your statistics.

The application is developed using React and Redux.
